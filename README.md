# PACS Project - Inhomogeneous, Viscous Burgers Equation Solver

### Author: Francesco Pettenon

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving the inhomogeneous, viscous Burgers equation, potentially including linear damping. The solution is achieved using a direct application of the Carleman linearization method combined with Euler's method. The results from this solver are compared with solutions generated by MATLAB's inbuilt solvers, offering a benchmark for accuracy and efficiency.

The current implementation is based on the methodology described in the paper ["Efficient quantum algorithm for dissipative nonlinear differential equations"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03185) by Jin-Peng Liu, Herman Ã˜ie Kolden, Hari K. Krovi, Nuno F. Loureiro, Konstantina Trivisa, and Andrew M. Childs.

## Problem Statement

We focus on solving an inhomogeneous, viscous Burgers equation:

```math
\partial_t u + u \partial_x u = \nu \partial_x^2 u + f
```

After space discretization, we describe the problem by the following \(n\)-dimensional quadratic ordinary differential equation (ODE):

```math
\frac{du}{dt} = F_2 u^{\otimes 2}+ F_1 u + F_0(t), \quad u(0) = u_{\text{in}}.
```

Here

```math
u = \begin{bmatrix} u_1, \dots, u_n \end{bmatrix}^T \in \mathbb{R}^n, \quad u^{\otimes 2} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1^2, u_1 u_2, \dots, u_1 u_n, u_2 u_1, \dots, u_n u_{n-1}, u_n^2 \end{bmatrix}^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n^2},
```

where each \(u_j = u_j(t)\) is a function of \(t\) on the interval \([0, T]\).

This problem is then linearized and solved using the **Carleman method**. We compare the solutions with those obtained with classical numerical methods, such as:

- Euler Method
- RK45
- Direct PDE solvers

## Usage Instructions

To set up and run the solver, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - First, clone the necessary repository with the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone --recursive https://github.com/pacs-course/pacs-examples.git
     ```
   - This will load the `pacs-examples` folder into your project directory.

2. **Modify Makefile:**
   - After cloning, modify the `PACS_ROOT` variable in the `Makefile` to point to the correct directory. This step ensures that the project is correctly configured with the necessary paths.

3. **Load Necessary Modules:**
   - Before proceeding with the installation, load the required modules by running:
     ```bash
     scripts/load_modules.sh
     ```

4. **Installation:**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     make install
     ```
   - This command installs the necessary dependencies and prepares the environment.

5. **Compilation:**
   - Compile the code by running:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
   - This will generate the executable files needed to run simulations.

6. **Set Library Path:**
   - Set the library path to include the `lib` directory:
     ```bash
     LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:$(pwd)/lib
     ```

7. **Execution:**
   - Execute the main simulation by running:
     ```bash
     ./main_executable
     ```

8. **Generating Documentation:**
   - To generate documentation, run:
     ```bash
     make docs
     ```

9. **Cleaning the Build:**
   - To clean up the build files, use:
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```

These steps will guide you through setting up, compiling, and running the solver, along with generating documentation and cleaning up your build environment.


## Folder Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **data/**: Contains input data files and parameter settings for the simulations. The primary files to be edited are `parameters.pot` and `parameters.json`. These files control various aspects of the simulation, including initial conditions, solver settings, and physical parameters.

- **include/**: Header files used throughout the project. This directory contains declarations for functions, classes, and templates that are implemented in the source files.

- **lib/**: 

- **src/**: Contains the source code of the project, further divided into subdirectories:
  - **discretization/**: Code related to the discretization of the PDEs and ODEs.
  - **error analysis/**: Modules for analyzing and calculating the error in the numerical solutions.
  - **initial conditions/**: Functions and classes for setting up the initial conditions of the simulations.
  - **params/**: Handling and processing of parameter files.
  - **plots/**: Generate plots with solution and errors.
  - **solvers/**: Implementation of the solvers, including Carleman linearization and Euler's method.
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers used across the project.
  - **mainSimulation.hpp** and **mainSimulation.cpp**: The main simulation implementation files that drive the core functionality.

- **main.cpp**: The entry point of the program where the main function resides. It orchestrates the flow of the program by initializing parameters, invoking solvers, and handling output.

- **Makefile**: Automates the build process, including installation, compilation, and cleaning of the project.

- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and a description of the project's structure.

This structure is designed to ensure that the project is modular, easy to navigate, and scalable for future developments.
